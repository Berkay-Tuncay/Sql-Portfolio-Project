<h1>Analyzing The Popularity of Programming Languages Over The Years</h1>

<h3>Project:</h3>
<h5>This project focuses on using Sql to explore and analyze popularity of spesific programming languages.</h5>

<h3>Aim & Questions:</h3>
<h4>Our goal is to analyze the usage and popularity of popular programming languages ​​by comparing them over the years and with other languages.</h4>
<h5>Question 1: How do we calculate the average usage of each language for each year?</h5>
<h5>Question 2: How do we find out whether the popularity of each language has increased over the years?</h5>
<h5>Question 3: How do we compare the total usage of each language by taking the average usage across all years?</h5>


<h3>Dataset:</h3>
<h5>MostPopularProgrammingLanguages.csv (from kaggle)</h5>

<h3>Conclusion:</h3>
<h5>We analyzed each language and year with many graphs we prepared. We calculated the usage rates in all years and Matlab appeared as the language with the highest usage rate.</h5>

<h3>Tech:</h3>
<h5>-Sql</h5>
<h5>-PopSql (Data Visualization & Queries)</h5>
